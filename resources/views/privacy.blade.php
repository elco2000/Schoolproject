        <h4><b>1.0: Personal Data</b></h4>
        <p>As a non-profit website, we will not sell any personal data users have given during registration.
        We do not take responsibility for all personal data that have been made public by users themselves,
        however, we will not place any personal data online at any point. Should any admin place anything personal
        about any users online, we will take full responsibility and take action accordingly.</p>
        <h4><b>1.1: Username and Password</b></h4>
        <p>Usernames are displayed publicly on the website, so that your channels correctly display to which user they belong to.
        Passwords, however, will never be displayed anywhere and we do not accept the publishing of any password anywhere.
        To ensure that the passwords are safe, the passwords are made invisible from everyone, including admins.</p>
        <h4><b>1.2: Sharing Content</b></h4>
        <p>Sharing content is done by the consent of the user. If this is not the case and we're warned, we will investigate this
        matter and act accordingly upon it. Should the content be sexual or highly offensive, we will look into this and,
        should the content indeed be inappropriate, we will immediately remove the channel(s) from the website and likely ban
        the user who posted the inappropriate content.</p>
