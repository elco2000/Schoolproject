        <p>Welcome to Free Entertainment, a website that we have built that allows YouTubers and Twitch streamers to
        advertise their content for free! We came up with the idea when we saw that it's very hard to
        advertise content without having to pay a considerable amount for it.</p>
        <p>We have decided to do something about this and construct a website where you can freely
        advertise your YouTube and/or Twitch.tv channel(s) without having to pay anything for it.</p>
        <p>We too share the big dream of reaching popularity with our YouTube and Twitch.tv channels.
        That is why we want to help you out reaching the popularity you want and deserve. We are even
        willing to give you tips and feedback to your channel if you wish it so.</p>
        <p>With us, you will have a place to stand on and start well with your channel(s). Feel free to
        ask any questions, should you have any. All forms of contact are found below.</p>
