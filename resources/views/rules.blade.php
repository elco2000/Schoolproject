        <h1 class="main-head">Rules</h1>
        <p>We find it important to create a fun and safe environment for every individual visiting the website.
        These rules should give you a guideline as to what we tolerate and what we don't:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Please keep a positive vibe when commenting on channels;</li>
            <li>Refrain from swearing or insulting;</li>
            <li>When sharing your channel, please do not share sexual or highly offensive content;</li>
            <li>When a user is reported, we expect said user to cooperate with the investigation. If the reported user does not
            cooperate with the investigation, we will be forced to suspend the reported user, until they elect to cooperate;</li>
            <li>Should anything inappropriate occur, please contact us immediately. When making an email towards us, please place
            the word "Report" and the name of the user in question in the subject of the email;</li>
            <li>Violations of the rules will result in warnings towards the violator. Should the violator continue to
            break the rules or refuse to cooperate, they will be suspended or their accounts will be deleted.</li>
        </ul>
